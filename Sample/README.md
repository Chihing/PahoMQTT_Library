## Sample

This is a very simple example that publishes a "Hello world!" message every 5 seconds. The message itself is a _LOCAL variable <code>Message</code>, so you can change what is published via the watch window. The topic and the IP address of the broker is defined in the Sample.c file. This sample currently doesnt handle a lost connection, see some of the [SampleNL](/SampleNL/README.md) examples for that feature.
